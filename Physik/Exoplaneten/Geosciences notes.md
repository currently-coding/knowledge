> As suggested recently [ 2], the addition of the phrase “standing bodies of water” to the HZ definition emphasizes that habitable zone planets incapable of supporting more than seasonal trickles of surface water, like Mars, should not be considered for follow-up astrobiological observations. This is because any life residing within such small amounts of water would be unlikely to modify the atmosphere in a detectable manner
