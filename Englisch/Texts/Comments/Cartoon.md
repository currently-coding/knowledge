Once quiet neighbourhoods becoming congested sights, local prices skyrocketing and traffic jams all around - these are all consequences of today's mass-tourism. While tourism provides a destination with wealth, it also inevitably hurts those who won't benefit from it. The cartoon depicts a sightseeing tour bus in front of a skyscraper-dominated neighbourhood with a tour guide stating that the very tourists themselves destroy the areas they ought to see. I agree with the cartoons message: Tourism destroys the sights it seeks to visit.

The main problem of mass-tourism is local infrastructure not being able to handle the masses that at the time of building were unbeknownst to the engineers. As this problem has its roots in plans made centuries ago it can rarely be compensated in any way leading to the visible symptoms of regular traffic jams and congested public spaces. Hence the city's value  overall decreases as tourist dislike being crammed into a small city, leading to the city losing it's tourist destination status due to the tourists themselves.

Even if the city were able to extend infrastructure to support the masses, the added infrastructure would damage the cities image. Imagine a rather rural, nicely kept up village becoming a tourist destination and therefore receiving new infrastructure to support this development. The cozy village now has a four-lane highway leading up to it and widened streets inside to support the new traffic. Now all of a sudden the image that led the tourists there in the first place is gone as well the city from the top of the tourist destinations.

In conclusion, it is clear that each city has a limited capacity of tourists it can take. Once that is surpassed a loss of value is inevitable as congested spaces and overloaded infrastructure deter tourists. Upgrading infrastructure, on the other hand, will taint the cities' image negatively. Thus most cities overloaded by tourists will - seizing the short-term opportunity of incoming wealth - upgrade their infrastructure at the cost of a long-term loss of tourists.
