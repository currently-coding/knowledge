	# Motivation
- `arrays` are complicated: set size, memory management, etc.
- sequential data types have bad assoziative access performance
- nested list(written by hand): little reusability, limited datatypes
=> **Need for a new way of storing data**

# Container from the STL
```cpp
std::array<T>       // set size, 
std::vector<T>      // dynamically growing
```
