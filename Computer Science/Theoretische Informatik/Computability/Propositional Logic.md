| Natural Language             | Meaning     | Symbol            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| and                          | conjunction | $\land$           |
| or                           | disjunction | $\lor$            |
| not                          | negation    | $\lnot$           |
| if ..., then ....            | implication | $\Rightarrow$     |
| if and only if .... then ... | equivalence | $\Leftrightarrow$ |
