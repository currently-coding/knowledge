## General
- Assume statement A to be true
- show by a chain of logical inferences that B is true
-> *prove implcations*

### Example 
#### Statements
A: "$p$ is an even prime"
B: "$p$ is less than $5$"

Now prove $A \Rightarrow B$
#### Prove
- Assume that $A$ is true => $p$ is an even prime.
- $A$ implies statement $C$: "$p$ is $2$" because every other even number is divisible by 2 and thus no prime
- $C$ implies $B$ as $2$ is less than $5$   $\square$
