A deterministic finite automaton(DFA)...
- is in *one* of a *finite number of states* at any time
- receives a word as input
- reads this input word character by character from *left to right*
- can change its state *after* each character read

The main features of a DFA are...
- Input Alphabet
- Finite set of states
- State transitions per state and read input symbols
- labeled start state
- accepting state
-> [[3.2 - DFA(deterministic finite automaton)|Definition]]

## Transition function $\delta$
- specifies how an automaton processes the stream of input characters.
