## Other computation models
- [[Structur-of-RAMs.png|RAMs]]
- [[2.46 - Turing Machine - TM|TM (definition)]]

## Differences
- no infinite storage
	- like hardware components
- like a $TM$ without the ability to write
## Problems well suited for it
- fast search in text, files, DNA sequences
- clear description of processes(e.g. GUI)
- modeling the behavior of distributed systems
