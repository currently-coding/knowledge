Let $A = (\sum, S, \delta, s_0, F)$ be a DFA.
- Express mathematically: A word $w \in \sum^*$ is **accepted by A** = $\bar{\delta}(s_0, w) \in F$
- The language accepted by **A**  is = $L(A) = \{w \in \sum^* | w \text{ is accepted by}\}$
- The **set of languages accepted by DFAs** is =  $FA = \{L(A) | A \text{ is a DFA}\}$
