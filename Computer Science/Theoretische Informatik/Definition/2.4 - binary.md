- The binary representation of $0$ is $0$
- Let $n \le 1$ and let $m \in N$ and $a_0, . . . , a_m \in \{0, 1\}$ with $a_m = 1$ and
$$
n = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_i \cdot 2^i
$$
Then the sequence $a_m, a_{mâˆ’1}, ..., a_0$ is called *binary representation of n*.

- Let **bin**: $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$ be defined via $n \mapsto bin(n)$, where $bin(n)$ denotes the binary representation of a number $n \in  \mathbb{N}$
