1. Every finite subset of $\mathbb{N}^n$ is decidable
2. $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}^n$ is decidable $\Longrightarrow A \cup B \text{ and } A \cap B$ decidable
3. $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{N}^n$ is decidable and $f: \mathbb{N}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^n$ is computable and total, then $f^{-1}(A)$ is decidable
## Proof idea
- statements can easily be derived from the definitions
