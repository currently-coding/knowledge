Each natural number $n \geqslant 1$ can be represented in exactly one way as
$$
n = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_i \cdot 2^i
$$with $m \in \mathbb{N}, a_m = 1 \text{and} a_0, ..., a_{m-1} \in \{0,1\}$

=> bin(x) is a [[01 Basic Notation and Terms#Functions|function]] and is [[01 Basic Notation and Terms#Functions|total]]
