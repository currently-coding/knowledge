- command line disassembler
- gets information about executable files and objects

## How to use
```terminal
objdump -R <executable>
```
- `-R` displays list of functions in the [[GHH/Linux Exploits/GOT]]

- `puts()`  has this address in the [[GOT]]: **`...4008`**
### Locate the Address called to get the Function
```terminal
objdump -M intel -d -j .plt ./<executable> | grep <unique address identifier>
``` 
- `-M intel` switches to [[Assembly#AT&T vs NASM|Intel Assembler Syntax]] instead of [[Assembly#AT&T|AT&T]]
- `-d` = `disassemble`
	- `-j .plt` specifies the [[Sections]] we want to display

```terminal
objdump -d ./hello.out | grep 4008
```
![[Pasted image 20240707093244.png]]
=> Syntax Differences become visible([[Assembly#AT&T vs NASM]])
=> **`1040`** is address called by the [[GHH/Linux Exploits/PLT|PLT]]
### Find call to `puts()`
- in `.text` [[Sections#.text|section]]
```terminal
objdump -M intel -d -j .text ./<executable> | grep <unique part of address>
```
=> see aforementioned syntax explanation [[objdump#Locate the Address called to get the Function|here]]

- **`11cf`** is the address pointing to `puts()`

### Finding References to Constant Strings
```terminal
strings -tx <executable>
```
- `-t` = radix
- `-x`  = hexadecimal
- together => prints offset within the file at the beginning of each string

```terminal
objdump -M intel -d ./<executable>  | grep -C1 <offset>
```
- `-C1` displays x=1 surrounding lines => helpful to grasp context
