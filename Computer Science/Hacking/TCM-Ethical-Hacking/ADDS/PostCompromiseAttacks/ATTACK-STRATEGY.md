# Post Compromise Attack strategy

## 1. We have an account - now what ?

## Quick wins:
- Kerberoasting
- secretsdump
- Pass the hash/Pass the password

## Dig deep:
- enumerate
- where does your account have access
- old vulnerabilites die hard (e.g. GPP Passwords)

## Think outside the box
