# Cracking Hashes with Hashcat

> Cracking best done on base OS with GPU for fastest cracking times

## Usage

```bash
hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show (--force -O)
```

- -m = Mode (Set hashing algorithm)
- hashes.txt = file with hashes
- /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt = wordlist with Passwords
- -O = optimized
- --show = show already cracked passwords/hashes as well
- --force = if on VM force cracking

### Rules
- Rules modify password spellings
BEST RULESET: "OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule"

## Full command
- put hashes into "hash.txt"
- cd into A:\Hacking\Hashcat
- specify rules with -r <ruleset.rule>
```bash
hashcat.exe -m 5600 hash.txt A:/hacking/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule -O --show
```
