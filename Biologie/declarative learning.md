- **Nature**: It's about "knowing that" something is the case, such as knowing facts, concepts, or events.
- **Memory Type**: Declarative memory is explicit, meaning you are aware of what you've learned and can intentionally recall it.
- **Examples**: Remembering historical facts, a person's name, or how to solve a math problem. Itâ€™s knowledge that you can describe or declare.
- **Brain Area**: The [[hippocampus]] and other areas of the medial temporal lobe are involved in declarative memory.
