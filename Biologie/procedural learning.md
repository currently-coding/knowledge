<!--SR:!2025-07-16,8,250-->

- **Nature**: mostly motor skills and actions
- **Memory Type**: Procedural memory is implicit, meaning you donâ€™t consciously think about the steps once you've mastered a skill.
- **Examples**: Learning to ride a bike, playing a musical instrument, or typing on a keyboard. Once you've learned these skills, you can perform them without needing to consciously think about each action.
- **Brain Area**: The basal ganglia and cerebellum are heavily involved in procedural memory.
