## Summary
- Students are chronically sleep-deprived -> daytime sleepiness
- Sleep quality and quantity are closely related to student learning capacity 
- Sleep loss in frequently associated with poor [[declarative learning|declarative]](relevant for students) and [[procedural learning]]
- actively restricting or optimizing sleep shows a worsening/improvement in neurocognitive and academic performance
- "all-nighters" do not affect cognitive performance significantly


## Summary
- sleep is an *active*, *repetitive* and *reversibly* behaviour
- **Functions of sleep**
		- repair
		- growth
		- *learning or memory consolidation*
		- restorative processes
	
	- sleep is often sacrificed for time
		- e.g. hobbies/interests
	- **Consequences of sleep loss**:
		- sleepiness
		-> facilitates cognitive, emotional, behavioural and academic failure
		-> reduces ability to learn from lessons([[declarative learning]]) or practical activities([[procedural learning]])
	- obesity
		- sleep deficit in childhood leads to higher risk of obesity in later years
	- Kreislaufproblem
	- *impairments in neurocognitive and psychomotor performance*
		- **Physical**
			- slower reaction time
				-> dangerous driving/falling asleep
		- **Mental**
			- reduces filtering efficiency

- **Consequences of All-Nighters**:
	- minimal effect on cognitive capacity

	- *acute sleep deprivation* does *not affect cognitive performance* in *healthy university students*, but affects physical performance
	- returned to baseline after 2 nights of recovery
- **Students**:
	- 71% do not reach 8h of sleep
	- rate sleep 2nd most important aspect regarding poor academic performance
- **Night workers**:
	- lower melatonin levels during daytime sleep
	- higher obesity risk
	- higher diabetes risk
- **Jet-Lag**:
	- bei >8GMT stark erhöhte Cortisol Menge
	- nach 4 Jahren konstanter Jet-Lag signifikant langsamere Reaktionszeit
	- schlechtere kognitiven Fähigkeiten
	-> durch erhöhte Cortisol level
## Optimal Sleep duration

## Schlafstadien
![[Pasted image 20250211115453.png]]
-> 1 cycle = ~90 minutes
	-> 4-5 cycles per night
- each state leads to deeper sleep
- 75% in NREM with majority in N2

Transitions between sleep and wake states are influenced by multiple brain structures, including:
**[[Hypothalamus]]:** controls onset of sleep
**[[hippocampus]]**: memory region active during dreaming
**[[Amygdala]]**: emotion center active during dreaming
**[[Thalamus]]**: prevents sensory signals from reaching the cortex
**[[Reticular formation]]:** regulates the transition between sleep and wakefulness
**[[Pons]]**: helps initiate REM sleep. The extraocular movements that occur during REM are due to the activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).
**Gender Differences**: 
- Men spend more time in N1 + more nighttime awakenings
	-> more daytime sleepiness
- Woman maintain longer slow-wave sleep
- Woman complain more about difficulties about falling asleep


### Characteristics of [[REM]]
- Associated with dreaming and irregular muscle movements as well as rapid movements of the eyes
- People tend to awaken spontaneously in the morning during an episode of REM sleep
- Loss of motor tone, increased brain O2 use, increased and variable pulse and blood pressure
- Increased levels of ACh
- The brain is highly active throughout REM sleep, increasing brain metabolism by up to 20%[[22]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/#)
## Cellular Level
**Initiating sleep**:
- GABA(Gamma-aminobutyric acid) acts as the *primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the [[central nervous system]]*
	- binds with GABA-A receptors in the brain -> promotes sleep
**Exiting sleep**:
	- GABA is released by sleep-promoting neurons
	-> triggers wake-promoting regions in hippothalamus and brainstem
- Acetylcholine(ACh), dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamin, hypocretin peptides *work together to maintain the waking state*

## Circadian Rhythm
- controls nocturnal release of
	- adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH)
	- prolactin
	- melatonin
	- norepinephrine

## Function of sleep
1. Neural maturation
2. Facilitation of learning or memory
3. Targeted erasure of synapses to "forget" unimportant information that might clutter the synaptic network
4. Cognition
5. Clearance of metabolic waste products generated by neural activity in the awake brain
6. Conservation of metabolic energy[[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/#)
